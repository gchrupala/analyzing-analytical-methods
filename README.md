## transformer-ASR experiments

The transformer-ASR model is a transformer model trained with
[ESPnet](https://github.com/espnet/espnet) on
[Librispeech](http://www.openslr.org/12/). The forked version of the code we
used to extract the activations is available from
[https://github.com/bhigy/espnet/tree/phoneme-repr]. The
[README](https://github.com/bhigy/espnet/blob/phoneme-repr/README.md) at the
root of the repository provides instructions for installation, while details about
activations extraction can be found under
[egs/librispeech/asr1/README.md](https://github.com/bhigy/espnet/blob/master/egs/librispeech/asr1/README.md).
